Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code includes necessary header files such as `<iostream>`, `<conio.h>`, and `<string>`, which are used for input/output operations, console functions, and string handling, respectively.

2. It defines and initializes several variables of different data types, such as integers (`n`, `amount`, `ded`, `count`, `l`, `dep`, `ac1`, `ac2`), a character (`s`), and a string (`name`, `password`).

3. Three classes (`first`, `second`, `third`) are defined, representing different stages of the banking system's functionality.

4. The `first` class contains a method `v1()` that displays a welcome message and prompts the user to insert their debit/credit/ATM card into the machine slot. It also asks the user to press '*' to continue and enter their PIN.

5. The `second` class, inheriting from `first`, includes a method `v2()` that checks the entered PIN. If the PIN is correct (2405), it displays a login success message. If the PIN is incorrect, it allows two additional attempts to enter the correct PIN. If the PIN is still incorrect after three attempts, a thank-you message is displayed.

6. The `third` class, inheriting from `second`, contains a method `v3()` that presents a menu of banking options to the user. The options include balance enquiry, withdrawal, deposit, money transfer, and quitting the system.

7. Depending on the user's choice (stored in the variable `n`), different actions are performed. For example, for option 1 (balance enquiry), a fixed balance of Rs. 50,000 is displayed. For option 4 (money transfer), the user is prompted to enter account numbers, amounts, and performs the transfer if the conditions are met. Option 2 (withdrawal) allows the user to enter an amount (in multiples of 100) and displays the debited amount and the remaining balance. Option 3 (deposit) asks the user to enter the amount to be deposited and displays the new total balance.

8. At the end of the `v3()` method, a thank-you message is displayed.

9. In the `main()` function, an instance of the `third` class is created, and the `v1()`, `v2()`, and `v3()` methods are called in sequence to simulate the flow of the banking system.
